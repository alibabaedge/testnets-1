# Upgrade time : Tuesday 4th APR 16:00 UTC, block height 1628800 may arrive earlier. 
Exact upgrade time can be checked [here](https://testnet.mintscan.io/neutron-testnet/blocks/1628800).

## Unfortunately because of the issue found in the v0.3.0 version you need to use v0.3.1 version instead
That problem was that `UpgradeHandler` was not implemented and migration of some modules parameters to new state was not made and taken into account.

### Release Details
    * https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v0.3.1
    * chain upgrade height : 1628800

# Steps to upgrade neutron chain (baryon-1)

## Step 1 : All upgrades will be done using cosmovisor.

* stop the neutron chain

```shell
   sudo systemctl stop neutrond
```

* Further follow the cosmovisor setup guide.

# Setup Cosmovisor

## Create the updated Neutron binary of v0.3.1

```shell
   mkdir -p ~/.neutrond/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.3.0/bin
```
* Go to neutron directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
```

* Follow these steps if neutron repo already present

```shell
   cd $HOME/neutron
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v0.3.1
   go mod vendor
   make install
```

## Check current neutron version
```shell
   ~/.neutrond/cosmovisor/current/bin/neutrond version
   # Output should be
   0.2.0
```

## Check the new neutron version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  $ neutrond version --long
  name: neutron
  server_name: neutrond
  version: 0.3.1
  commit: b24c6e1ac76ff33ed3f51efbbf36390a7d3decc0
```

## Checksum of the binary

```shell
$ shasum -a 256 neutrond
0a92982d15cfcea18d0b5adf510d78435b2c678c9947e4a69912f6d7a25a8ed2 neutrond
```

## Copy the new neutron (v0.3.1) binary to cosmovisor upgrades directory

```shell
